# Gen AI Powered Documentation Specialist - BRD Generation

## Overview

This project is a Proof of Concept (POC) for a "Gen AI Powered Documentation Specialist" focused on generating Business Requirement Documents (BRDs) using CrewAI. The goal is to automate the extraction and structuring of key information from meeting transcripts to create comprehensive BRDs.

## Features

- **Automated BRD Generation**: Utilizes advanced AI agents to analyze meeting transcripts and produce well-structured BRDs.
- **Agent Roles**: Includes a Business Analyst agent and a Subject Matter Expert (SME) agent to ensure both functional and technical requirements are accurately captured.
- **Semantic Search and File Read Tools**: Enhances the agents' capabilities to process and extract relevant information from transcripts.
- **Gradio Interface**: Provides an easy-to-use web interface for uploading meeting transcripts and displaying the generated BRD.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API Key
- Gradio
- Mammoth
- CrewAI

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rawahabinkhalid/gen-ai-doc-specialist.git
    cd gen-ai-doc-specialist
    ```

2. Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Set up environment variables:

    Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your OpenAI API key:

    ```
    openai_api_key=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY
    ```

## Usage

1. Ensure you have a meeting transcript in `.docx` format ready for processing.

2. Run the application:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

3. Open the provided Gradio interface URL in your web browser.

4. Upload your meeting transcript `.docx` file.

5. The AI agents will process the transcript, and the generated BRD will be displayed in markdown format.

## File Structure

- `app.py`: Main application file containing the Gradio interface and processing logic.
- `brd-template/`: Directory containing the BRD template in markdown format.
- `meeting-transcription/`: Directory where processed meeting transcripts will be saved.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.
- `.env`: Environment file for storing sensitive information like API keys.

## Code Explanation

### Main Components

- **Agent Definition**: Defines the roles and goals of the Business Analyst and SME agents.
- **Task Definition**: Specifies the tasks for each agent, including detailed instructions on how to process the meeting transcript and fill out the BRD template.
- **Crew Configuration**: Configures the agents and tasks within a hierarchical management process.
- **File Processing**: Handles the upload and conversion of meeting transcripts from `.docx` to markdown format.
- **Gradio Interface**: Provides a user-friendly web interface for uploading files and displaying results.

### Key Functions

- `call_crew_kickoff(str_current_datetime)`: Initializes and runs the CrewAI agents to process the meeting transcript and generate the BRD.
- `process_file(input_file)`: Handles file upload, conversion, and invokes the `call_crew_kickoff` function to process the transcript.
- `demo.launch()`: Launches the Gradio interface.
